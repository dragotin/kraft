The following section briefly describes how to build Kraft with cmake.

-----------------------------------------------------
Quick-start 0: Precondition
-----------------------------------------------------

Check that cmake is installed on your machine and is in your PATH.
To do so, just type

$ cmake --version

on your command line. Version 2.4 is required, the most recent
stable version of cmake is preferred.

To build Kraft, the following libs and software versions have to
be provided:
- KDE libs incl. devel packages version > 4.4.0
- KDE Pimlibs (for Akonadi based kaddressbook access)
- google ctemplate, A simple but powerful template language for C++,
  packages from the openSUSE Buildservice or from the website
  http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate/

-----------------------------------------------------
Quick-start 1: Build Kraft
-----------------------------------------------------

cmake is designed so that the build process can be done in a separate
directory. This is highly recommended for users and required for packagers.

Go to the top level of the cvs working directory or the source tarball.
To build Kraft in the subdirectory ./build/ type

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
    to generate the Makefiles.
$ ccmake .
    to change the configuration of the build process. (optional)

Congratulations, your Makefiles were generated!
Now you could just type

$ make
    to build the project in the build/ directory.

Note that 'make' automatically checks whether any CMakeLists.txt file
has changed and reruns cmake if necessary.

Congratulations, you will never have a chaos of generated files
between the important source files again!

Kraft Installation
==================

Database
========

Since version 0.40 Kraft either can use a SQLite file based 
database or a MySQL server based database.

The SQLite database is created automatically on the fly
on first start. Its use is recommended for all users who
want to evaluate Kraft.

To run Kraft with MySQL, create or pick a user on the MySQL
server with appropiate permissions to write to a specific
database and create tables on it. Create an empty database
to use with Kraft. Remember both the database name and the
credentials.
On Krafts first start, enter these data in the setup assistant.
Kraft will create the database tables and fill it automatically.

Document Generation
===================

Kraft generates PDF documents. For that it uses a python tool named
erml2pdf. The tool can be found in Kraft's tools directory in this
source package. 

erml2pdf uses a python lib called the ReportLab Toolkit: a mature, 
Open Source PDF library which can be found at 
http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html
Furthermore it uses python-pypdf for pdf processing.

erml2pdf must be in the system path to be found by kraft.
